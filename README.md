## Description 

Have you ever wanted a place where you could find recipe ideas online, and be able to share your own ideas for others to see all in the same location? Well, now you can with, ReciPlanner!!!

What could be considered the new "Reddit" of recipes and meal plans, ReciPlanner is filled with recipes shared from many users. With a user friendly landing page, you can see which ones are the most popular, and with the upvote system, you can vote which ones are your favorite. Add the ones you like the most to your recipe list, so you can always find them for later. After adding a recipe to ReciPlanner you can share them with others, but don't worry, you can always edit or delete them later! We’ve got a constant stream of YouTube cooking videos for you to checkout, in addition to great meal prep routines!

## Usage 

When you first website you are presented with a simple layout:


![alt text](. "Quickly search for a stock!")


Upon entering the stock ticker, you will be shown relevant stock information, as well as prior opening and closing prices of the stock in one-hour intervals:


![alt text](./assets/images/stock.png "Snapshot of opening and closing prices of stock by the hour!")


Hovering over a stock price will make the text pop out and allow for easier readability


![alt text](./assets/images/hover.png "Move your mouse cursor over the stock to make the text pop!")


By simply using the navigation bar on top of the website you can quickly jump to the news articles associate with the stock ticker you just looked up!


![alt text](./assets/images/nav.png "Quickly navigate through the website!")


Hovering over the news articles will dynamically change the container


![alt text](./assets/images/news.png "Make the article stand out!")


Clicking on the article will open up the article in a separate tab for you to read more in depth about the stock!


![alt text](./assets/images/preview.png "Get more in depth information before investing!")

As you search for more and more stocks, a list of your recently searched stocks will be displayed for easy access!


![alt text](./assets/images/save.png "Build a small watchlist of stocks!")


As you build your stock watchlist, clicking on one of the saved stocks will display current stock information and news articles so you're always up to date!

![alt text](./assets/images/load.png "A simple click brings all the stock information!")


Finally, at the bottom of our application, you will find a small section dedicated to the four developers of this application:computer:.
